# Plugin Utils Functions for Figma

This plugin was created to learn myself TypeScript. It can be, and it will be maintain to add new features on it.

I'm a french junior dev so sorry for my bad english, I hope you understand my comments !

## Installation

Create a new plugin in Figma, delete all the files in the new directory that Figma will create and then clone this repo inside.

Then:

1. Install all the dependencies: `npm i`.
2. For development mode: `npm run dev`
3. For production mode: `npm run build`

## Next Features
